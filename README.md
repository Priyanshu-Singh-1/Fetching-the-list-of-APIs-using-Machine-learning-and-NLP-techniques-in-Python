# Fetching-the-list-of-APIs-using-Machine-learning-and-NLP-techniques-in-Python

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are in
high demand, which has resulted in the development of several
APIs with a wide range of functionalities. However, identifying
and obtaining pertinent information regarding APIs can be
difficult for developers. To solve this problem, we created a
web-based tool called "Auto Scrapper" that uses Python-based
machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to make getting the list of APIs easier. Utilizing
information retrieval (IR) techniques, Auto Scrapper also
includes a recommendation engine that generates tailored
suggestions depending on the user's search history. With a
database of over 10,000 APIs that is regularly updated to give
developers the most recent information, the tool is made to be
versatile and scalable.
